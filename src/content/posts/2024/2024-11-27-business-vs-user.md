One of the memorable talks from my years studying Photography at University, came from a tutor on a different course.

He had spent his early years making short films and documentaries and started to work in advertising.

Then came a decision.

He was offered the chance to make an advert for McDonalds.

What should he do?

A significant amount of money was offered for the job, but creating work for a multi-national food conglomerate responsible for rapidly rising obesity rates was morally challenging.

It all came down to the question. Take the money, or keep to your principles.

Am I a wolf, or a sheep?
