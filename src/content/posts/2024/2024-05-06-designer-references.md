I come across a lot of design work and portfolios online. This is a list of some of the best that I've seen so far this year.

### Seungmee Lee
Super cool projects. Separated her film photography into a projectâ€¦ nice! Shows the variation in design skill.

### Andreas Gysin
ASCI art gone wild. Website and projects look cool, if a little hard to comprehend fully.

Dan (gr8 name) is doing the kind of work I aspire towards. Go Dan.
