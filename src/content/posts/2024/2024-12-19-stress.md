The past 6 weeks I've become increasingly more stressed.

The word stress is often associated without mental wellbeing, but I've also noticed my resting heart rate growing steadily upwards.

From 50-55 in November to almost 60-65 in December, and I can really *feel* it.

It's a combination of a lot of work, taking care of two young children, and everything in between.

I've been in situations like this before, and I've usually found that taking time off and regrouping is the best way to manage.

Simply stopping what your doing, taking time off, reflecting and returning to my 5 core foundations.

- Reading
- Writing
- Cooking
- Friends & family
- Movement

I usually find that when I return to these, my stress starts to disapear completely.
