Goals are usually things we _want_ but _have difficulty achieving_ even when we know they are achievable.

Otherwise, we wouldn’t need a goal in the first place.

That sense of struggle is also captured in the term _behavior change_, which I use interchangeably with goal pursuit here.

It’s not engaging in behavior, per se, but rather _new_ behavior that is hard.

To pursue what most people call a goal involves doing something different than what has been done before.

**For example, a primary incentive underlying achievement motivation (i.e., the need for achievement) is to demonstrate one’s capability to perform well on a new or challenging task**
