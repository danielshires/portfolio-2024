Modern life is brutal.

In fact, if you don’t stop to really think about it, it mostly just passed by you without so much of a hint of what is truly happening.

The brutally comes in the form of abundance and distraction through technology, the internet, news, media and everything in between.

I’ve recently been considering the effects of abundance and distraction on my own mental wellbeing.

I’ve started to make conscious efforts to be mindful of technology that is consciously driving my everyday thinking and behaviour.

All this is to say that, your mind is truly something to be cherished.

It’s a sacred little garden, an oasis in the middle of a mega-metropolis, and it deserves to be protected.
